A Selenium script is utilized to receive a product link, sizes, and a discount to apply,scrapes all relevant information about the product, translates any reviews, and generates a name tailored to the specified region (in this case, Colombia). The script then evaluates whether the product has color and creates a JSON file to send to the WooCommerce API in order to create the product. After the creation of the product, the script also handles the size/color variations and finishes by adding the reviews.
